Hello there! I'm a Technical Writer. I write docs, guides, and FAQs to help users solve software problems effectively. I'm interested in a lot of things - OSS, AI/ML, and computers being some of them, as well as culture and languages.

My GitHub hosts learning projects - mostly Linux-y. They're experimental in nature, and I'm proud to have grown by creating and maintaining them.
